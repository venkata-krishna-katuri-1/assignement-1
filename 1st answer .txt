ssh key can be generated in our local system by typing 

1.ssh-genkey in windows terminal 
2. go to path where the key is created in our system 
3. check for options (uncheck the option view ) and apply it
4. you can see .pub file which is public and open it with note pad 
5. copy it and login in your github account and go to settings open new ssh key 
6 . add title and paste the key and there we can connect our system 

importance of ssh keys is :

-> while we use aws cloud or any cloud computer when we want to connect them to our system 
we can use this ssh keys 

-> this should be carefully done because we should not give our ssh to anyone ...so that our system may be hacked.

-> thus , we can make changes in our system , so that cloud computer system also changes automactically .
